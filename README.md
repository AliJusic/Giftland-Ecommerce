# GiftLand Ecommerce Website

This is a Ecommerce website created using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Sanity.io](sanity.io). It started as a learning project by diving head first and learning by doing. The webpage design was crafted using Canva to bring a personalized touch to the project.

## My experience

During the work on this project I have learned a lot and I had quite fun doing it from design to development phase. Despite encountering challenges along the way, such as discovering more efficient methods and techniques, I found learning by doing to be rewarding. I'm eager to apply newfound knowledge to enhance the project further.
